      <h3>Hobbies</h3>
      <h4>League of Legends</h4>

      <p>One of my favorite ways to spend my free time is playing League of Legends (LoL). LoL is a multiplayer online battle arena where two teams of five players each face off in a competition to see who can take the other teams base first. The first team to destroy the opponent's nexus (a structure in each team's base) wins the game. I enjoy League beacuse it is a fun mix of strategy and dexterity.</p>
      <h4>Dungeons and Dragons</h4>

      <p>Starting sophomore year of college, my friends and I have met most weekends during the semester to play Dungeons and Dragons (DnD). DnD is a role playing game where each person creates a character by choosing their profession, race, and creating a backstory. Each person then plays the game as if they were the character they created and goes off on whatever adventure the Game Master has prepared for them. DnD is a fun way to hang out with friends and immerse yourself in a fantasy world.</p>
